- Reduce sleep (room for even less sleep?)
- Support soft resets 
	- Not sure if I ended up using this or not
	- Idea is to not reset env when ray horizon is reached, as horizon is typically 100-1000 steps, while episodes may last for 1000's of steps
- Horizon has off-by-one bug (fixed)
- Support setting unique fixed seed for each unity instance
- Update to ray==2.3.0
	- e.g., support gymnasium instead of gym
	- --> use (truncated, terminates) instead of done



NEW MODIFICATIONS:
- Gather information from the environment
	- Get the number of agents
	- Get action and observation spaces automatically (no need to manually specify)

VECTOR Version (for cleanrl):
- Use Gymnasium "standard" format rather than rllib dictionary format
- Concatenate observations for single agent
