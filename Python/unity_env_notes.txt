- Reduce sleep (room for even less sleep?)
- Support soft resets 
	- Not sure if I ended up using this or not
	- Idea is to not reset env when ray horizon is reached, as horizon is typically 100-1000 steps, while episodes may last for 1000's of steps
- Horizon has off-by-one bug (fixed)
- Support setting unique fixed seed for each unity instance
- Update to ray==2.3.0
	- e.g., support gymnasium instead of gym
	- --> use (truncated, terminates) instead of done
